<h1>Hi, I'm Anshul!
  [<img align="centre" alt="Anshul | Instagram" width="100px" src="https://github.com/Anshuls-repo/for-assignment/blob/master/NicePng_aws-logo-png_2467323%20(1).png" />][credly]</h1>
I would like to share with you a few projects that I have commenced since embarking on my cloud and devops journey. I believe that these projects have helped me to develop my skills and knowledge in this exciting field, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in the world of cloud computing and DevOps.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects & Hands-On's:</h2>

- [<b>Run Infra as Code with Jenkins:</b>](https://github.com/Anshuls-repo/Works-Projects-Hands-on/blob/main/AWS/Projects/Run%20Infra%20as%20Code%20with%20Jenkins.pdf)
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a powerful approach to managing IT infrastructure by writing code to automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of resources. Jenkins, on the other hand, is a popular automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
By combining the two, you can create a robust and efficient process for managing infrastructure. Using Jenkins, you can deploy it to the cloud environment.
 
- [<b>Deploying a Multi-Tier Website Using AWS EC2:</b>](https://github.com/Anshuls-repo/Works-Projects-Hands-on/blob/main/AWS/Projects/Project%201%20-%20Deploying%20a%20Multi-Tier%20Website%20Using%20AWS%20EC2.pdf)
  - Company ABC wants to move their product to AWS.They have the following things setup right now: 
    1. MySQL DB 
    2. Website (PHP) The company wants high availability on this product, therefore wants autoscaling to be enabled on this website.

- [<b>Implementing DevOps Lifecycle:</b>](https://github.com/Anshuls-repo/Works-Projects-Hands-on/blob/main/Projects/Project-%20DevOps.pdf)  
  -  Code Build should automatically be triggered once a commit is made to master branch or develop branch. If commit is made to master branch, test and          push to prod If commit is made to develop branch, just test the product, do not push to prod 
  -  The Code should be containerized with the help of a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile should be built every time there is a push to Git-Hub. 
  -  The above tasks should be defined in a Jenkins Pipeline, with the following Jobs Job 
         Building Website Job 
         Testing Website Job 
         Push to Production 
         
 - [<b>Using Microsoft Azure Implement the below architecture for website:</b>](https://github.com/Anshuls-repo/Works-Projects-Hands-on/blob/main/Projects/AZURE%20PROJECT.pdf)
