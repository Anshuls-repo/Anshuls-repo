<h1>Hi, I'm Anshul!</h1>
I would like to share with you a few projects that I have commenced since embarking on my cloud journey. I believe that these projects have helped me to develop my skills and knowledge in this exciting field, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in the world of cloud computing.
<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Projects & Hands-On's:</h2>

- <b>Run Infra as Code with Jenkins:</b>
  - [Run Infra as Code with Jenkins Doc](https://github.com/Anshuls-repo/Works-Projects-Hands-on/blob/main/AWS/Projects/Run%20Infra%20as%20Code%20with%20Jenkins.pdf)
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a powerful approach to managing IT infrastructure by writing code to automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of resources. Jenkins, on the other hand, is a popular automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
By combining the two, you can create a robust and efficient process for managing infrastructure. Using Jenkins, you can deploy it to the cloud environment.
