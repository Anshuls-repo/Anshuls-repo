<h1>Hi, I'm Anshul!</h1>
Hello, my name is Anshul! I would like to share with you a few projects that I have commenced since embarking on my cloud journey. I believe that these projects have helped me to develop my skills and knowledge in this exciting field, and I am eager to continue learning and growing in the world of cloud computing.

- <b>Run Infra as Code with Jenkins:</b>
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a powerful approach to managing IT infrastructure by writing code to automate the provisioning, configuration, and deployment of resources. Jenkins, on the other hand, is a popular automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
By combining the two, you can create a robust and efficient process for managing infrastructure. Using Jenkins, you can deploy it to the cloud environment.
